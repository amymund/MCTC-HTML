    <h2 id="headline"> How Mayhem Lived and Breathed Black Metal</p>
     <ul>
          <li>Members of the band were connected to a series of Norwegian church burnings.</li>
<li>Lead Singer "Dead" was the first black-metal musician to wear corpse paint - but beyond this Dead would even bury his stage clothes and dig them up to wear on concert nights.</li>
  <li>During performances, Dead would often cut himself with hunting knives and broken glass.</li>
  <li>The band frequently featured pig or sheep heads impaled on stakes at the front of the stage.</li>
  <li>Dead committed suicide in the house rented by the band. He was found by Euronymous, who discovered him with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's suicide note began with "Excuse all the blood" ...</li>
 <li>Upon discovering Dead’s body, Euronymous went to a nearby store, purchased a disposable camera, and photographed the corpse after rearranging certain items.</li>
  <li>Rumors circulated that Euronymous had made a stew from bits of Dead's brain and fashioned necklaces from fragments of his skull.</li>
  <li>Hellhammer  penned the lyrics to "Pagan Fears" in his own blood in October 2019.</li>
    <li>On the 10th of August 1993,  Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was discovered outside the apartment, bearing twenty-three stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.</li>
